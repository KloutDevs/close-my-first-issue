# Close My First Issue

Don't feel confident using GitHub in a team (yet)?

Practice the open source contribution workflow by closing your very first issue, step by step ðŸ’ª.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/fork.png" alt="fork this repository" />

## Step 1. Get assigned a practice issue

1. [<img align="left" width="150" src="https://i.imgur.com/0Cdusgy.png">](https://discord.com/invite/jnMj34qPAg)
<br/><br/>
2. Enter `/join-github-org YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME` in the #get-started message field
3. Accept the invite GitHub emails you to join *The Fast Tracked Programmer* organization

After you've accepted the invite, a mentor will

1. open and assign you a practice issue to close in this project, which will appear under [open issues assigned to you](https://github.com/the-fast-tracked-programmer/close-my-first-issue/issues?q=is%3Aopen+assignee%3A%40me)
2. reach out to offer guidance and support in our awesome discord [#community](https://discord.com/channels/815407176734212126/894788853045530624). See the [trello board](https://trello.com/b/WFrU7822/close-my-first-issue) for details.


## Step 2. Fork this repository

Fork this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page.

This will create a copy of this repository in your GitHub account, that you can publish your local changes to.

## Step 3. Clone your forked repository

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/clone.png" alt="clone this repository" />

Now clone the forked repository to your machine.

Go to your GitHub account, open the forked repository, click on the code button and then click the _copy to clipboard_ icon.

Open a terminal and run the following git command:

```
git clone "url you just copied"
```

where "url you just copied" (without the quotation marks) is the url to this repository (your fork of this project). See the previous steps to obtain the url.

<img align="right" width="300" src="https://firstcontributions.github.io/assets/Readme/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="copy URL to clipboard" />

For example:

```
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/close-my-first-issue.git
```

Here you're copying the contents of the close-my-first-issue repository on GitHub to your computer.

PS. If you don't have git on your machine, [install it](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/).

## Step 4. Create and checkout a local branch

Change to the repository directory on your computer (if you are not already there):

```
cd close-my-first-issue
```

Now create a branch using the `git checkout` command:

```
git checkout -b new-branch-name
```

For example:

```
git checkout -b add-<your-github-username>
```

## Step 5. Add, stage and commit local changes

Now create `profiles/<your-github-username>.md` in your editor, add `## Hi, I'm <your-github-username>` to the file and then save it.

Upon executing the command `git status`, you'll see there are changes.

Stage those changes with the `git add` command:

```
git add profiles/<your-github-username>.md
```

And commit those changes using the `git commit` command:

```
git commit -m "add <your-github-username>"
```

## Step 6. Push local commits to remote branch

Push your changes using the command `git push`:

```
git push origin add-<your-github-username>
```

## Step 7. Open a pull request

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://i.imgur.com/XdpuEWB.jpg" alt="create a pull request" />

If you go to your repository on GitHub, you'll see a `Compare & pull request` button.

Click on that button to start creating a pull request.

<img align="right" width="200" src="https://i.imgur.com/4rgWAKC.jpg" alt="submit pull request" />
<br/>

Our mentors will then be notified of your pull request and either approve and merge your updates, or request changes.

You will get a notification in either case.

We both share a vision of wanting to help beginners to contribute to open source projects, and used their [first-contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) repository as a base.

We have not forked their repository or preserved commit history because we wanted to keep things as simple as possible for our community of aspiring contributors.
